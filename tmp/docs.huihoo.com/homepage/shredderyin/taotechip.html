</font><p><font size="5">Here are some tantalizing excerpts from the newest computer-assisted
translation of Lao Tzu's famous
</font></p><h1 align="center"><font size="5">TAO TE CHIP</font></h1><h3 align="center"><font size="5">The Way of the One and the Zero</font></h3><font size="5"><br>
</font><p><font size="5">With all due apology to Stephen Mitchell, who's translation was the basis for
this, and, of course, Lao Tzu.

<font size="5">The tao that can be <code><b>tar</b></code>(1)ed<br>
is not the entire Tao.<br>
The PATH that can be specified <br>
is not the full PATH.<br>
<br>
We declare the names<br>
of all variables and functions.<br>
Yet the Tao has no type specifier.<br>
<br>
Dynamically binding, you realize the magic.<br>
Statically binding, you see only the hierarchy.<br>
<br>
Yet magic and hierarchy<br>
arise from the same source,<br>
and this source has a null pointer.<br>
<br>
Reference the NULL within NULL,<br>
it is the gateway to all wizardry.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">2</font></h2>
<font size="5">When users see one GUI as beautiful,<br>
other user interfaces become ugly.<br>
When users see some programs as winners,<br>
other programs become lossage.<br>
<br>
Pointers and NULLs reference each other.<br>
High level and assembler depend on each other.<br>
Double and float cast to each other.<br>
High-endian and low-endian define each other.<br>
While and until follow each other.<br>
<br>
Therefore the Guru <br>
programs without doing anything<br>
and teaches without saying anything.<br>
Warnings arise and he lets them come;<br>
processes are swapped and he lets them go.<br>
He has but doesn't <code><b>chown</b></code>,<br>
acts but doesn't <code><b>expect</b></code>.<br>
When his work is done, he deletes it.<br>
That is why it lasts forever.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">3</font></h2>
<font size="5">When you overesteem great hackers,<br>
more users become cretins.<br>
When you develop encryption,<br>
more users become crackers.<br>
<br>
The Guru leads<br>
by emptying user's minds<br>
and increasing their quotas,<br>
by weakening their ambition<br>
and toughening their resolve.<br>
When users lack knowledge and desire,<br>
management will not try to interfere.<br>
<br>
Practice not-looping,<br>
and everything will fall into place.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">4</font></h2>
<font size="5">The Tao is like a glob pattern:<br>
used but never used up.<br>
It is like the <code><b>extern void</b></code>:<br>
filled with infinite possibilities.<br>
<br>
It is masked but always present.<br>
I don't know who built it.<br>
It came before the first kernel.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">5</font></h2>
<font size="5">The Tao doesn't take sides;<br>
it gives birth to both wins and losses.<br>
The Guru doesn't take sides;<br>
she welcomes both hackers and lusers.<br>
<br>
The Tao is like a stack:<br>
the data changes but not the structure.<br>
the more you use it, the deeper it becomes;<br>
the more you talk of it, the less you understand.<br>
<br>
Hold on to the root.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">6</font></h2>
<font size="5">The Tao is called the Great Server:<br>
empty yet inexhaustible,<br>
it gives birth to infinite networks.<br>
<br>
Its code is present within you.<br>
You can apply it any way you want.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">9</font></h2>
<font size="5">Fill your disk to the brim<br>
and it will fragment.<br>
Keep adding features to your utility <br>
and it will become unusable.<br>
Chase after royalties and license fees<br>
and your heart will never unclench.<br>
Care about a luser's approval<br>
and you will be his prisoner.<br>
<br>
Do your work, then logout.<br>
The only path to serenity.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">12</font></h2>
<font size="5">Graphics blind the eyes.<br>
Audio files deafen the ear.<br>
Mouse clicks numb the fingers.<br>
Heuristics weaken the mind.<br>
Options wither the heart.<br>
<br>
The Guru observes the net <br>
but trusts his inner vision.<br>
He allows things to come and go.<br>
His heart is as open as the ether.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">14</font></h2>
<font size="5">more, and it can't be read.<br>
find, and it can't be located.<br>
grep, and it can't be scanned.<br>
<br>
In the foreground, it isn't a hog.<br>
In the background, it isn't idle.<br>
Contiguous, unpatchable,<br>
it lives below the realm of logic.<br>
From there it includes all formulas,<br>
an image without a viewer,<br>
virtual, beyond all conception.<br>
<br>
Rewind it and there is no beginning;<br>
Fast forward and there is no end.<br>
You can't know it, but you can be it,<br>
at ease in your own life.<br>
Just realize where you log from:<br>
this is the essence of wisdom.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">15</font></h2>
<font size="5">The ancient Wizards were profound and subtle.<br>
Their wisdom was unfathomable.<br>
There is no way to describe it;<br>
all we can do is read their source code.<br>
<br> 
They were careful<br>
as someone writing an unbuffered stream.<br>
Alert as a warrior in a dangerous MUD.<br>
Courteous as an anonymous ftp.<br>
Fluid as a morphing face.<br>
Shapable as an interpolated spline.<br>
Receptive as a dialup slip connection.<br>
Clear as a sharpened bitmap.<br>
<br>
Do you have the patience to wait<br>
till the broadcast storm subsides and the net is clear?<br>
Can you mask interrupts <br>
till the right thunk arises by itself?<br>
<br>
The Guru doesn't seek fulfillment.<br>
Not seeking, not throwing exceptions,<br>
she is present, and can welcome all things.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">17</font></h2>
<font size="5">When the Guru administers, the users <br>
are hardly aware that he exists.<br>
Next best is a sysop who is loved.<br>
Next, one who is feared.<br>
And worst, one who is despised.<br>
<br>
If you don't trust the users,<br>
you make them untrustworthy.<br>
<br>
The Guru doesn't talk, he hacks.<br>
When his work is done,<br>
the users say, "Amazing:<br>
we implemented it, all by ourselves!"<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">18</font></h2>
<font size="5">When the great Tao is forgotten,<br>
standards and protocols appear.<br>
When management makes initiatives,<br>
the great pretense begins.<br>
When there is no peace in the newsgroup,<br>
bigots spread their theology.<br>
When the system becomes fragmented,<br>
Holy Wars are born.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">19</font></h2>
<font size="5">Throw away documentation and manuals,<br>
and users will be a hundred times happier.<br>
Throw away privileges and quotas,<br>
and users will do the Right Thing.<br>
Throw away proprietary and site licenses,<br>
and there won't be any pirating.<br>
<br>
If these three aren't enough,<br>
just stay at your home directory <br>
and let all processes take their course.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">30</font></h2>
<font size="5">Whoever relies on the Tao in administrating <br>
doesn't try force issues<br>
or defeat enemies by revoking privilages.<br>
For every hack there is a counterhack.<br>
Flaming, even with a good intention,<br>
will only bring flames in return.<br>
<br>
The Guru does his job<br>
and then signs off.<br>
He understands that the net<br>
is forever beyond his control,<br>
and that trying to dominate events<br>
goes against the current of the Tao.<br>
Because he believes in himself,<br>
he doesn't try to convince others.<br>
Because he is content with himself,<br>
he doesn't need others' approval.<br>
Because he accepts himself,<br>
the whole net accepts him.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">32</font></h2>
<font size="5">The Tao can't be perceived.<br>
Smaller than an bit,<br>
it contains uncountable files.<br>
<br>
If powerful men and women<br>
could remain centered in the Tao,<br>
all things would be harmony.<br>
The net would become a paradise.<br>
All users would be at peace,<br>
and the standards would be <br>
those written in their hearts.<br>
<br>
When you have versions and releases,<br>
know that they are provisional.<br>
When you have consortia,<br>
know where their functions should end.<br>
Knowing when to stop,<br>
you can avoid any danger.<br>
<br>
All things end in the Tao<br>
as sendmail flows into the net.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">36</font></h2>
<font size="5">If you want to <code>compress</code> something,<br>
you must first <code>pkunzip</code> it.<br>
If you want to get rid of a virus,<br>
you must first allow it to flourish.<br>
If you want to <code>get()</code> something,<br>
you must first allow it to be <code>put()</code>.<br>
This is called the subtle perception<br>
of the way things are.<br>
<br>
Soft mounting overcomes the hard error.<br>
Brute force overcomes the heuristic.<br>
Let your algorithms remain a mystery.<br>
Just show users the results.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">40</font></h2>
<font size="5">The <code>return</code> is the function of the Tao.<br>
Responding is the way of the Tao.<br>
<br>
All things begin as source code.<br>
Source code begins with an empty file.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">42</font></h2>
<font size="5">The Tao gives birth to One.<br>
One gives birth to One Zero.<br>
One Zero gives birth to One One.<br>
One One gives birth to all things.<br>
<br>
All things have their backs to the input <br>
and stand facing the output.<br>
When output and input combine,<br>
all things achieve harmony.<br>
<br>
Ordinary users hate solitude.<br>
But the Guru makes use of it,<br>
embracing his aloneness, realizing<br>
he is one with cyberspace.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">43</font></h2>
<font size="5">A tiny bug in a trivial routine <br>
will overcome a moby system.<br>
That which has no fee<br>
enters where there is no market space.<br>
This shows the value of "AS IS."<br>
<br>
Teaching without manuals,<br>
performing without commands:<br>
that is the Guru's way.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">46</font></h2>
<font size="5">When a system is in harmony with the Tao,<br>
the compiler makes applications and utilities.<br>
When a system goes counter to the Tao,<br>
accounting logs fill the root directory.<br>
<br>
There is no greater illusion than fear,<br>
no greater wrong than in preparing to defend yourself,<br>
no greater misfortune than having an enemy.<br>
<br>
Whoever can see through all fear<br>
will always be safe.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">47</font></h2>
<font size="5">Without opening a graphics window,<br>
you can open your soul to the net.<br>
Without looking away from the console,<br>
you can see the essence of the Tao.<br>
The more files you access,<br>
the less you hack.<br>
<br>
The Guru accesses without protocols,<br>
finds his man pages without keywords,<br>
optimizes without compiling.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">48</font></h2>
<font size="5">In the pursuit of knowledge,<br>
every day something is appended.<br>
In the practice of the Tao,<br>
every day something is truncated.<br>
Less and less do you need to force things,<br>
until finally you arrive at non-looping.<br>
When nothing is done,<br>
nothing is left undone.<br>
<br>
True wizardry can be gained<br>
by letting things go their own way.<br>
It can't be gained by interrupting.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">49</font></h2>
<font size="5">The Guru has no mind of her own.<br>
She works with the mind of the users.<br>
<br>
She is good to users who are good.<br>
She is also good to users who aren't good.<br>
This is TRUE goodness.<br>
<br>
She trusts users who are trustworthy.<br>
She also trusts users who aren't trustworthy.<br>
This is TRUE trust.<br>
<br>
The Guru's mind is like free space.<br>
Users don't understand her.<br>
They look to her and wait.<br>
She treats them like child processes.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">54</font></h2>
<font size="5">Whoever is planted in the Tao<br>
will not have their account revoked.<br>
Whoever embraces the Tao<br>
will not become obsolete.<br>
Their .signatures will be met with honor<br>
from generation to generation.<br>
<br>
Let the Tao be present in your home <br>
and you will become genuine.<br>
Let it be present in your group <br>
and your group will flourish.<br>
Let it be present in your system <br>
and your system will be an example<br>
to all the systems in the net.<br>
Let it be present in cyberspace <br>
and all cyberspace will sync.<br>
<br>
How do I know this is true?<br>
By accessing myself.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">60</font></h2>
<font size="5">Administering a large system<br>
is like frying a small fish.<br>
You spoil it with too much poking.<br>
<br>
Center your system in the Tao<br>
and lossage will have no power.<br>
Not that it isn't there,<br>
but you will be able to step out of its way.<br>
<br>
Give lossage nothing to oppose<br>
and it will disappear by itself.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">68</font></h2>
<font size="5">The best MUD player <br>
wants his opponents berserking.<br>
The best consortium partner <br>
lauds the products of his competitor.<br>
The best corporate rep <br>
serves the communal good.<br>
The best sysop <br>
follows the will of the users.<br>
<br>
All of them embody<br>
the virtue of non-contention.<br>
Not that they don't love to compete,<br>
but they do it with the spirit of hack-and-slay.<br>
In this they are like wannabees<br>
and congruent with the Tao.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">70</font></h2>
<font size="5">My teachings are easy to grok <br>
and easy to include in your programs.<br>
Yet your neural net will never grasp them,<br>
and if you try to code them, you'll fail.<br>
<br>
My teachings are older than the net.<br>
How can you grep their meaning?<br>
<br>
If you want to know me,<br>
look to your kernel.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">71</font></h2>
<font size="5">Not-knowing is true knowledge.<br>
Presuming to know is a bug.<br>
First realize that you are broken;<br>
then you can move toward perfection.<br>
<br>
The Guru is her own debugger.<br>
She has flushed herself of all knowing.<br>
Thus she is truly whole.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">72</font></h2>
<font size="5">When they lose their sense of awe,<br>
users turn to religious wars.<br>
When they no longer trust themselves,<br>
they begin to depend upon the authorities.<br>
<br>
Therefore the Guru steps back<br>
so that users won't be confused.<br>
He teaches without instructions,<br>
so that users will have nothing to learn.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">73</font></h2>
<font size="5">The Tao is always at ease.<br>
It computes without grinding,<br>
answers without outputing a word,<br>
switches without being signaled,<br>
continues without a program.<br>
<br>
It accesses all cyberspace.<br>
And though it spans many volumes,<br>
is doesn't drop any bytes.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">74</font></h2>
<font size="5">If you realize that all code changes,<br>
there is nothing you should try to archive.<br>
If you aren't afraid of hard drive failure,<br>
there is nothing you can't achieve.<br>
<br>
Trying to control the future<br>
is like trying to debug a running kernel.<br>
When you try to debug the system's kernel,<br>
chances are you'll panic and crash.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">75</font></h2>
<font size="5">When license fees are too high,<br>
users do things by hand.<br>
When the management is too intrusive,<br>
users lose their spirit.<br>
<br>
Hack for the user's benefit.<br>
Trust them; leave them alone.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">79</font></h2>
<font size="5">Failure is an opportunity.<br>
If you blame another user,<br>
there is no end to the blame.<br>
<br>
Therefore the Guru <br>
fulfills her own obligations<br>
and debugs her own code.<br>
She hacks what she needs to do<br>
and demands nothing of her coworkers.<br>
</font><h2><font size="5">80</font></h2>
<font size="5">If a system is administered wisely,<br>
its users will be content.<br>
They enjoy hacking their code<br>
and don't waste time implementing<br>
labor-saving shell scripts.<br>
Since they dearly love their accounts,<br>
they aren't interested in other machines.<br>
There may be telnet, rlogin, and ftp,<br>
but these don't access any hosts.<br>
There may be an arsenal of cracks and malware,<br>
but nobody ever uses them.<br>
People enjoy reading their mail,<br>
take pleasure in being with their newsgroups,<br>
spend weekends working at their terminals,<br>
delight in the doings at the site.<br>
And even though the next system is so close<br>
that users can hear its keys clicking and biff beeps,<br>
they are content to die of old age<br>
without ever having gone to see it.<br>
