<h1>Changing Variables</h1>
Sometime, you would rather use other variables names than <i>x and
y</i> for your plots. GnuPlot allows you to change the name of the
independent variable. You do this using the <b>set dummy</b>
command. For instance, if you were working with 2D plots with <i>t</i>
as the independent variable,
<ul><li><b>plot sin(x)</b>  - Would bring up the graph
<li><b>set dummy t</b>
<li><b>plot sin(x)</b> - Would give you the error <i>undefined
variable: x</i>.
<li><b>plot sin(t)</b> - Would bring up the graph again.
</ul>
You can change the dummy variables for 3D plots as well, with one of
the following:
<ul><li><b>set dummy u, v</b> - To change x to u, and y to v
<li><b>set dummy ,v</b> - To just change y to v</ul>
For more information, see <b>help set dummy</b>.
