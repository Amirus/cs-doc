<h1>Saving and Loading from a File </h1>
Gnuplot lets you load a series or commands in from a file.
This is useful when you are trying to "tweak" a lengthy expression to
get the output that you want. If you haven't used an UNIX editor
before, you will probably want to start with <b>PICO</b>. You can
start it within a terminal window by typing <b>pico</b>, or you can
select it from the Editors menu of the Wright Hall Menu. For
information on how to use Pico, see <a
href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/Help/pico.html">here</a>. For instance, you might need to enter
the following lines to get a graph that you want.
<ul><li><b>set time<li>set title "File Graph"
<li>set hidden3d<li>set xrange [-5:5]<li>set yrange [-5:5]
<li>set isosamples 50<li># Actually Plot the Graph
<li>splot exp(-x**2 - y**2) -cos(y)-(x**2)/5</b></ul>
You could put this in your home directory in a file called, for
instance, "work.gnu". Then to run these commands, you would type the
following in GnuPlot:
<ul><li> <b>load 'work.gnu'</b></ul> Or if the file is in a differant
directory, <ul><li><b>load 'web/gnuplot/work.gnu'</b></ul> This file
is on the system, if you want to try it, type <ul><li><b>load '/opt/Gnu/info/gp/work.gnu'</b></ul>
The line beginning with the "<b>#</b>" is a comment line. You can put
these in your text files as comments to yourself.
<h2> Changing Directories</h2>
If you want to put the file in another directory than your home
directory, you just need to use the <b>cd</b> command in
GnuPlot. First, to see what directory you are in, type the following:
<ul><li><b>pwd</b></ul>
You should see something like "/user/bos", where your username is in
place of "bos". To change directories, just use the cd command as follows:
 <ul><li><b>cd "web/gnuplot"</b></ul>
<h2> Adding Pauses, Looping Animations</h2>
To make changing GnuPlot graphics, you can specify multiple plots, and
just put <b>pause</b> statements between them. For more information,
see <b>help pause</b>. For an example, type <b>load
'/opt/Gnu/info/gp/work2.gnu'</b>. Also, if you put a <b>reread</b>
statement into your text file, it causes GnuPlot to go the beginning
of the file, and keep looping. For more information, see <b>help
reread</b>, and for an example, type <b>load
'/opt/Gnu/info/gp/work3.gnu'</b>. To exit the loop, hit
<b>Control-C</b> in the GnuPlot window.
<h2>Saving Work</h2>
The option that GnuPlot gives for saving work is the <b>save</b>
command. If you type the following:
<ul><li><b>save "mywork.gnu"</b></ul>
GnuPlot will then create a text file with the name you gave it that
includes <b>set</b> commands for every possible setting in
GnuPlot. You can then load this file to continue work where you left off.
