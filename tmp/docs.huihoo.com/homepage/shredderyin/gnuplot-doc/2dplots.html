<h1><a name="2dplots">Graphing Two Dimensional Functions</a></h1>

The command used for two-dimensional plots is <b>plot</b>. The
simplest use of it is:
<ul>
<li>plot &lt;function&gt;
</ul>
For example, to plot <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>, type
<ul><li><b>plot x**3</b></ul>
You should see something like the following pop up in the graphics
screen.

For another example, to see what the hyperbolic cosine function looks
like, type
<ul><li><b>plot cosh(x)</b></ul>
This should display

Note that in this picture the scale isn't the best for finding a lot
of information about the graph. It tells us that the function gets
very large as <i>x</i> gets larger. But if we want to see what the
function looks like closer to 0, we need to change the scale. Gnuplot
uses an autoscale mechanicism. It sets the scale so that the graph
will fit on the screen. To change the scale, use one of the following
forms of <b>plot</b>:
<ul><li><b> plot [x1:x2] [y1:y2] &lt;function&gt</b>
<li><b> plot [x1:x2] &lt;function&gt</b> (To just set the x range)
<li><b> plot [] [y1:y2] &lt;function&gt</b> (To just set the y range).
</ul>
Note, that if you set the range for the x values on one plot, they
will stay that way for future plots. To set the default x range back
to [-10,10], type the following:
<ul><li>set xrange [-10:10]</ul>
Also, if you set the range for the y values, they will stay the same
for future plots as well. You can set GnuPlot back to autoscaling the
y axis by typing the following:
<ul><li>set autoscale y</ul>
For more information on the <b>set xrange</b> and <b>set autoscale</b>
commands, use the help command.

To see what cosh looks like from <i>x=[-5, 5]</i>, type
<ul><li><b> plot [-5:5] cosh(x)</b></ul>
Or, to see what cosh looks like from <i>y=[0, 10]</i>, type
<ul><li><b> plot [] [0,10] cosh(x)</b></ul>
