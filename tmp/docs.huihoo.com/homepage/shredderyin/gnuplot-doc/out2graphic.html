<h1> Outputing to Graphics files</h1>
You cannot output directly from GnuPlot to Graphics files. You could
use the convert command (<i>convert test.ps test.gif</i>) if you had
printed to a file, or you can use the screen grab option in Image
Magick. Do the following to get a graphics files version of a graph.
<ol><li> Have the graph you want displayed in a graphics window.
<li> Have ImageMagick started. You can do this by typing <b>display
&</b> in a shelltool or commandtool (not at the gnuplot prompt).
<li> If you didn't have Gnuplot already running, choose Load from the
menues that pop up when you hold a mouse button down over Image
Magick's screen.
<li> Choose <b>Grab</b>
<li> Move the Grab window if you have to, and make sure that the
window with your graph in it is unobstructed.
<li> Click Okay in the Grab Window. Then click the left mouse button
in the window with the Graph you want.
<li> After a couple of seconds, a copy of the graph should pop up in
GnuPlots' window. You can resize it or apply effects to it within
ImageMagick.
<li> Choose <b>Save</b> from ImageMagick's menu.
<li> Choose <b>format</b> from the Save screen.
<li> Select the graphics type you want (i.e., <i>.gif</i> or
<i>.jpeg</i>.
<li> Give the file the name you want, and click on Save.
</ol>
