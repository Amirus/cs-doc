<h1> Generating Output </h1>
The next couple of pages deal with getting output from the graphs you
have created. There are several ways you can do this:
<ul>
<li><B>Print to a Printer</b> - This would be useful if all you need
is a paper copy of the graph you have constructed.
<li><b>Output to a Postscript File</b> - This would be useful if you
would like to print multiple copies, or would like to have the image
available to print at a later time without replotting it.
<li><b>Output to a Encapsulated Postscript File</b> - This would be
useful if you would like to include the graphics in a
document. Most work processors and desktop publishers (i.e.,
FrameMaker) import EPS files with the highest quality.
<li><b>Output to a Graphics File</b> - This would be useful if you
wanted to post the image on the web</ul>
