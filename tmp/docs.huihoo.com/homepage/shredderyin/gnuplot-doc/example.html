For a quick example, let's say you wanted a graph of
<i>sin(x)</i>. You would then type the following at the <b>gnuplot>
</b> prompt:
<ul><li>plot sin(x)</ul>
This will pull up another window with the graph you wanted. If you
made a mistake or want to slightly change what you typed, hit the
<b>UP ARROW</b>. This will pull up what you typed. If you have typed a
couple of lines, you can keep hitting the arrow button. The you can
use the left and right arrow keys to change what you typed. As a quick
example, try changing what you typed to
<ul><li>plot sin(2*x)</ul>
