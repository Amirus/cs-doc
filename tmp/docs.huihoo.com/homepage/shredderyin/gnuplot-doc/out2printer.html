<h1> Printing to Printer</h1>
Once you have the plot you want on the screen, do the following to
print the graphic to a printer:
<ul><li><b>set output "| lp"</b> - This will make the graphic screen
disappear
<li><b>set terminal postscript</b>
<li><b>replot</b>
<li><b>set output "| lp"</b> - You can use the up arrow to call this
line up again.
</ul>
After the last command, you should see a message like the following:
<ul><li><i>gnuplot> set output "|lp"<br>       
request id is lj3sib-961 (standard input)</i></ul>
This means that is was printed.
<p>
To go back to having the graphical display, type the following:
<ul><li><b>set terminal x11</b> - (x11 is the type of windowing
system the Suns use)</ul>
If you want to print later, you only have to do the last three of the
commands, i.e.,
<ul>
<li><b>set terminal postscript</b>
<li><b>replot</b>
<li><b>set output "| lp"</b> - You can use the up arrow to call this
line up again.
</ul>
Note that the <b>lp</b> in the output command is the print command for
your machine. Use can use the following for the output command:
<ul>
<li><b>set output "| lp"</b> - Prints to the default printer for your
machine. For machines in Wright 339, this <i>lj3sib</i>.
<li><b>set output "| lp -dlj3sia"</b> - Prints to the specified
printer. <i>lj3sia</i> is in Wright 339 as well.
<li><b>set output "| lp -n 3"</b> - Prints more than one copy (in this
case, 3 copies). This can be combined with the -d option as well.
</ul>
