<h1><A name="SnQ">Starting and Quitting Gnuplot</a></h1>
To access Gnuplot, you probably want to be logged into one of the Suns
in Wright 339. It is possible to run GnuPlot on any Xserver, but that
is beyond the scope of this document. When you are logged into a Sun, you can do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>At the prompt on one of the suns, type <b>gnuplot</b> <p>
<li>Pick GnuPlot from the Wright Hall Menu that comes up when you hold
the Right mouse button down.
</ul>
To quit gnuplot, type <b>exit</b>, or hit Control-D.<p>
